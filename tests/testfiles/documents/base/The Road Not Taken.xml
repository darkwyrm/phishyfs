    <title>The Road Not Taken</title>
    <para/>
    <para>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</para>
    <para>And sorry I could not travel both</para>
    <para>And be one traveler, long I stood</para>
    <para>And looked down one as far as I could</para>
    <para>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</para>
    <para/>
    <para>Then took the other, just as fair,</para>
    <para>And having perhaps the better claim,</para>
    <para>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</para>
    <para>Though as for that the passing there</para>
    <para>Had worn them really about the same,</para>
    <para/>
    <para>And both that morning equally lay</para>
    <para>In leaves, no step had trodden black.</para>
    <para>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</para>
    <para>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</para>
    <para>I doubted if I should ever come back.</para>
    <para/>
    <para>I shall be telling this with a sigh</para>
    <para>Somewhere ages and ages hence:</para>
    <para>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—</para>
    <para>I took the one less traveled by,</para>
    <para>And that has made all the difference.</para>
