Phishy File Scanner is a utility written in Python for determining how likely a file is a phishing threat. PFS is intended to be run by e-mail clients and the like for helping a user determine how dangerous a file attachment could be.

This is accomplished by rating the file based on various attributes, such as file type, extension, and potential for executable code.
